# Changelog

## v1.4 (April 3, 2026) -- COMPLETE
- Extended molecular dynamics to 100ns (was 10ns) on RTX 4090
- Fixed PBC artifact: per-chain RMSD analysis instead of whole dimer
- 100ns results: compound dimer more compact than WT (RMSD 6.22 vs 7.16 A)
- Equilibrium RMSD (>50ns): compound 6.88 vs WT 8.17 A (Cohen's d = 4.31)
- Per-chain RMSD: WT A=6.89/B=7.44, Compound A=5.67/B=6.76
- t-test (equilibrium): p < 1e-323 (highly significant)
- Both systems reach equilibrium at ~62-66ns
- Added verify_md.py: 34 independent verification checks (validated 2x)
- Added strided trajectory loading for memory-safe analysis of 50+ GB DCD files
- Added RMSD CSV exports for reproducibility
- Updated all documents with corrected 100ns findings
- Updated run_md.py with PBC correction and per-chain analysis

## v1.3 (March 29, 2026) -- COMPLETE
- Extended to 10 independent seeds per configuration (64 total AlphaFold predictions)
- 3 of 4 key metrics now survive Bonferroni correction (was 1 of 4 with 5 seeds)
- ipTM: p=0.003, Bonferroni p=0.035 (significant)
- pTM: p=0.003, Bonferroni p=0.031 (significant)
- pLDDT@429: p<0.000001, Bonferroni p=0.000005 (highly significant)
- 10ns molecular dynamics simulations completed (OpenMM, Amber14, Google Colab A100)
- MD results: compound dimer RMSD 7.34 vs WT 5.29 A (p=1.05e-17)
- RMSF at pos 222: 9.76 A vs 1.47 A (6.6x more flexible in compound)
- RMSF at pos 429: 6.96 A vs 1.61 A (4.3x more flexible in compound)
