## Why This Document Exists

MTHFR biology sits at the intersection of folate metabolism, homocysteine regulation, methylation biology, neurotransmitter-relevant one-carbon metabolism, and vitamin-dependent pathway function. Because downstream findings are often discussed within separate specialties, relevant literature can appear fragmented. This document brings selected strands together into a single research framework and pairs them with a computational structural comparison designed to prioritize experimentally testable hypotheses.

Common MTHFR variants are widely distributed in human populations, and current clinical guidance does not treat most common variant states as stand-alone indications for major treatment changes. This document does not argue otherwise. Its purpose is narrower: to identify structural and biochemical questions that may warrant orthogonal validation.

Recent advances in structure prediction and related translational tools make it reasonable to explore whether selected MTHFR variant states merit deeper experimental study. In this document, computational modeling is used for hypothesis prioritization only. The goal is not to claim mechanism, disease causation, clinical utility, or therapeutic readiness.

## Core Boundaries of This Document

This document does not demonstrate reduced enzyme activity, altered FAD affinity in vitro, retinal injury, neuropsychiatric causation, or editing feasibility. Structural models described here are predictions, not experimentally resolved structures. Any future translational or therapeutic discussion remains downstream and contingent on substantial biochemical, structural, cellular, preclinical, regulatory, and clinical validation.

## PART 1: Scientific Context

### 1.1 The MTHFR Enzyme

MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) is a FAD-dependent enzyme encoded on chromosome 1p36.22. It converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), the primary circulating form of folate and the methyl donor for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine.

Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a major cellular methyl donor involved in DNA methylation, neurotransmitter-relevant pathways, myelin maintenance, hormone metabolism, and broader one-carbon biology.

MTHFR functions as a homodimer. The crystal structure (PDB: 6FCX, 2.5 A resolution, Froese et al. 2018, *Nature Communications*) revealed a catalytic TIM-barrel domain (N-terminal, FAD-binding) connected by a 25-amino-acid linker to a SAM-binding regulatory domain (C-terminal). In 2024, cryo-EM structures (PDB: 8QA5, 8QA6) further defined SAM-mediated allosteric inhibition through dual SAM binding and inter-domain conformational rearrangement, providing structural context for the regulatory-domain position of A1298C.

### 1.2 The Two Key Variants

| Property | C677T (rs1801133) | A1298C (rs1801131) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Amino acid change | Ala222Val | Glu429Ala |
| Domain affected | Catalytic domain, FAD-related region | Regulatory domain, SAM-related region |
| Literature context | Altered enzyme stability, reduced FAD affinity, thermolabile behavior, elevated homocysteine in some contexts | Discussed in relation to regulatory behavior and BH4-relevant pathways, with mechanism and subgroup specificity remaining incompletely defined |
| Reported activity effects | Literature reports reduced activity, with strongest evidence in TT homozygotes | Literature reports activity effects, with interpretation varying across study design and context |
| Population frequency | Varies by population | Varies by population |
| Compound heterozygous context | Literature reports reduced overall enzyme activity relative to wild-type, with possible contributions from both catalytic and regulatory context |

Compound heterozygosity, one copy of each variant, has been reported in the literature to produce lower overall enzyme activity than wild-type, with effects that may involve both catalytic-domain and regulatory-domain context.

### 1.3 Primary Follow-Up Contexts

The present document prioritizes two downstream follow-up contexts from the broader literature.

#### Primary follow-up context: Retinal biomarkers

Prior literature links MTHFR-related one-carbon pathway disruption and hyperhomocysteinemia to retinal injury, making retinal follow-up a reasonable primary downstream context for experimental testing. Selected findings include:

- Mthfr+/- mice show increased retinal homocysteine, ganglion cell loss, thinner nerve fiber layer, and vascular leakage (Markand et al., 2015, *IOVS*)
- MTHFR modifies CRB1-related retinal phenotypes in the rd8 model (Markand et al., 2015, *Experimental Eye Research*)
- A case report described visual recovery associated with betaine treatment in severe MTHFR deficiency (Hergert et al., 2022, *Journal of Neurology*)
- Retinal perfusion improved in compound C677T/A1298C carriers receiving genotype-guided supplementation with Ocufolin medical food (Jiang et al., 2023, *Clinical Ophthalmology*)

In the present document, retinal biology is treated as a candidate biomarker domain for follow-up, not as an outcome established by the computational results.

#### Secondary exploratory context: Neuropsychiatric-relevant biochemistry

A1298C has been discussed in relation to BH4-relevant pathways, and one-carbon disruption has been discussed in relation to neurotransmitter-relevant biochemistry. However, mechanism, effect size, and subgroup specificity remain incompletely defined. Selected findings include:

- Meta-analysis has reported associations between MTHFR polymorphism and psychiatric phenotypes across several diagnostic categories (Wan et al., 2018, *Translational Psychiatry*)
- Compound heterozygous patients have been described in treatment-responsive clinical contexts involving SAMe and methylated B vitamins when MTHFR status is identified (Levin and Varga, 2016)
- These observations support exploratory biochemical follow-up in defined subgroups, rather than a primary disease-focused conclusion

In the present document, this context is treated as secondary and exploratory.

### 1.4 Additional Literature Context

Published literature also discusses MTHFR across autism and cerebral folate deficiency, B-vitamin processing, cardiovascular biology, DNA methylation, and reproductive health. In the present document, those broader domains are treated as background context rather than as outcomes established by the computational analysis.

### 1.5 Author Genotype Context

The following variants are reported from the author's consumer genomic testing. These data are included as personal context and hypothesis motivation only. Consumer genomic findings require confirmation in a clinical or research-grade setting.

| Gene | Variant | rsID | Zygosity | Classification | Context |
|------|---------|------|----------|----------------|---------|
| MTHFR | C677T (A222V) | rs1801133 | Hetero (AG) | Clinically Significant | Catalytic-domain variant with literature support for altered enzyme stability and reduced activity in some contexts |
| MTHFR | A1298C (E429A) | rs1801131 | Hetero (TG) | Conflicting or Uncertain | Regulatory-domain variant discussed in relation to one-carbon and neurotransmitter-relevant pathways, with mixed interpretation across sources |
| MTRR | I22M (c.66A>G) | rs1801394 | Hetero (AG) | Likely Pathogenic | Variant in downstream B12-related metabolism that could be relevant to one-carbon pathway context, pending phenotype-specific interpretation |

> Voluntary disclosure: These personal genomic results are shared voluntarily as context for the research question. They do not strengthen the computational evidence by themselves and should not be treated as clinical findings without independent confirmation.

### 1.6 MTRR Co-occurrence as a Contextual Factor

MTRR (methionine synthase reductase) regenerates the active form of vitamin B12, the essential cofactor for methionine synthase, the enzyme immediately downstream of MTHFR. Co-occurring variation in MTRR may therefore be relevant to one-carbon pathway context when present alongside selected MTHFR states.

In this document, MTRR I22M is included as contextual background rather than as a modeled result. The computational analysis does not determine the functional contribution of MTRR I22M, and it does not establish that co-occurring MTRR variation explains phenotype severity. However, this genotype combination may be relevant to variability among compound heterozygous individuals and may warrant stratified follow-up in future studies.

## PART 2: Computational Prioritization Framework

### 2.1 Purpose

Computational structure prediction, AlphaFold 3 Server and Boltz-2, was used to compare predicted structural confidence across wild-type, single-variant, and compound heterozygous MTHFR states in complex with FAD cofactor, THF substrate, and SAM allosteric inhibitor.

These predictions are used for hypothesis prioritization only. They do not establish mechanism, disease causation, clinical relevance, or therapeutic feasibility.

### 2.5 Comparative Observations Within the Tested Model Set

1. Monomer predictions showed preserved overall folding across the tested variant states. The tested monomer outputs do not suggest large-scale loss of overall folding confidence.
2. Dimer predictions showed comparative inter-chain differences. FAD-associated confidence values were lower in the tested dimer models than in the tested monomer models, consistent with the different interaction context of the homodimer.
3. The compound heterozygous dimer yielded the lowest comparative confidence values across the assessed dimer-level metrics in both independent runs.
4. Compound heterozygous dimers averaged lower than the tested comparators, consistent with a possible combined dimer-level perturbation hypothesis in this modeling setup.
5. Independent random seeds produced consistent directional trends across the tested configurations, supporting limited internal reproducibility within this modeling setup.
6. In the Boltz-2 THF comparison, the compound heterozygous ligand ipTM was lower than wild-type, consistent with a possible difference in modeled substrate-associated context at the dimer level.

### 2.6 Core Observation

Monomer predictions showed preserved overall folding across the tested variant states, whereas dimer predictions showed comparative inter-chain differences. This is the central comparative finding of the current computational dataset and the main basis for downstream experimental prioritization.

### 2.7 What This Computational Section Does Not Show

This computational framework does not demonstrate reduced enzyme activity, altered FAD affinity in vitro, disease causation, retinal injury, neuropsychiatric causation, or therapeutic feasibility. It does not prove that observed confidence differences are biologically meaningful. Those questions require independent biochemical, structural, cellular, and clinical investigation.

## PART 3: Sequence Correction as a Downstream Translational Question

Sequence correction remains a downstream translational question rather than a conclusion of the present document. Because C677T is a single-nucleotide variant, base-editing logic can be discussed in principle. However, this document does not establish MTHFR as a therapeutic editing target and does not address guide design, edit-window fit, bystander edits, delivery, rescue, or safety.

Any serious consideration of sequence correction for MTHFR would require supportive evidence from prior stages, including biochemical validation, structural confirmation, cell-based studies, and target-specific safety assessment.

| 6 | If cell-based feasibility and safety data support further progression, preclinical animal studies using appropriate Mthfr-relevant models and multi-organ outcome measures | 24 to 36 months | $500K to $2M | Requires institutional partner |
| 7 | If preclinical data support advancement, IND-enabling planning, regulatory strategy development, and early clinical trial concept design | 3 to 7+ years | $5M+ | Requires biotech or pharma partner |

> Advancement between phases is conditional and depends on supportive data at each prior stage. This roadmap is a planning framework, not a claim of therapeutic readiness.
