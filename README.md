# MTHFR Variant Target Validation Program

### Structural Analysis of Dimer Stability, Cofactor Binding, and Substrate Interaction in High-Risk MTHFR States

> **This project presents a computational structural analysis of wild-type, single-variant, and compound heterozygous MTHFR states using AlphaFold 3 and Boltz-2. Across both platforms, the compound heterozygous dimer showed the weakest predicted interaction profile for dimer interface, FAD-associated binding, and THF-associated binding. These findings support a focused program of experimental validation. The present work is intended to prioritize experiments, define measurable hypotheses, and support collaboration with structural biology, metabolic disease, retinal, and neuropsychiatric researchers.**

## Who I Am (And Who I Am Not)

**I'm not a biohacker. I'm not trying to be something I'm not.**

My name is Igor Mihaljko. I'm a cybersecurity specialist, cloud solution architect, and infrastructure architect with 20+ years in IT. I run an AI marketing agency called DSM.Promo in Chicago.

I'm just a guy who thinks outside the box. I looked at my genetic test results, started asking questions that crossed the boundaries between medical specialties, and used AI tools to organize what I found. This project exists because I believe the next generation deserves better -- and sometimes it takes someone from outside a field to see what the people inside it can't.

**This project started with my own DNA.** I discovered I carry compound heterozygous MTHFR mutations (C677T + A1298C). When I started researching what this means, I found that the same variant enzyme is connected to seven disease categories explored in the literature -- and nobody had put the full picture together in one place.

I built this project to hand it to the real scientists. Everything is here -- the sequences, the protocols, the analysis pipeline. Take it. Build on it. Prove me wrong or prove me right.

## The Problem Nobody Connected

Modern medicine is organized by organ system. Ophthalmologists treat eyes. Psychiatrists treat anxiety. Neurologists study autism. Cardiologists manage heart disease. Nutritionists advise on B-vitamins.

**Nobody steps back to see that MTHFR dysfunction is implicated across all seven disease pathways.**

Thousands of papers have been published on individual aspects of MTHFR. But no single document connects all seven disease pathways to one genetic variant and proposes a unified experimental correction strategy using modern structural biology tools. That's what this project does.

### Why Has Nobody Tried to Fix This Genetically?

As of March 2026, among ~250 active CRISPR clinical trials worldwide, **zero target MTHFR.** Why?

| Reason It Was Ignored | Why That's Wrong |
|----------------------|------------------|
| "It's just a polymorphism" | 40% prevalence ≠ benign. 1.5-2 billion people carrying these variants across diverse populations |
| "Supplements work fine" | Lifelong, imperfect, addresses downstream effects not the genetic variant. The enzyme carries variant alleles in every cell |
| Specialists stay in lanes | 7 diseases = 7 specialties. No one sees the full picture |
| Structural data didn't exist | First crystal structure 2018, cryo-EM 2024, AlphaFold 3 2024 |
| Gene therapy targets rare diseases | PCSK9 editing (VERVE-102, YOLT-101) demonstrates common-variant correction is technically feasible |

**What changed:** AlphaFold 3 + adenine base editing (proven in humans) + LNP delivery (proven at scale) + 2024 cryo-EM structures = a window that didn't exist two years ago. This project exists to open it.

## The MTHFR Enzyme

**MTHFR** (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, EC 1.5.1.20) is a FAD-dependent homodimeric enzyme that converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate -- the primary circulating form of folate and the methyl donor for converting homocysteine to methionine.

### Known Structures

| PDB | Year | Method | Resolution | What It Shows |
|-----|------|--------|------------|---------------|
| [6FCX](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6FCX) | 2018 | X-ray | 2.5 A | First human MTHFR crystal structure -- homodimer with catalytic TIM-barrel + regulatory SAM-binding domain (Froese et al., *Nat Commun*) |
| [8QA5](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8QA5) | 2024 | Cryo-EM | -- | MTHFR + SAH dis-inhibited (active) state -- single SAH bound, catalytic domain flexible (Froese et al., *Nat Commun*) |
| [8QA6](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8QA6) | 2024 | Cryo-EM | -- | MTHFR + SAM inhibited state -- dual SAM binding reorients catalytic domain, blocks substrate access |

### The Two Key Variants

| Variant | rsID | Position | Domain | Mechanism | Population Frequency |
|---------|------|----------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **C677T (A222V)** | [rs1801133](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?term=rs1801133) | 222 (catalytic) | FAD-binding TIM-barrel | Displaces helix alpha-5, disrupting FAD-interacting residues Asn168, Arg171, Lys172. Creates thermolabile enzyme. ~35% activity loss per allele. | 24-50% (varies by ethnicity) |
| **A1298C (E429A)** | [rs1801131](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?term=rs1801131) | 429 (regulatory) | SAM-binding domain | Near the SAM-binding pocket identified in 2024 cryo-EM structures. Impairs BH4 recycling. ~30% activity loss per allele. | ~25% European |

**Compound heterozygosity** (one copy of each) produces ~50-60% of normal enzyme activity -- a dual hit affecting both catalytic function and regulatory feedback simultaneously.

## My Genetic Variants

| Gene | Variant | rsID | Zygosity | Classification | Relevance |
|------|---------|------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **MTHFR** | **C677T (A222V)** | rs1801133 | **Hetero (AG)** | Clinically Significant | Catalytic domain -- FAD cofactor binding destabilized. All 7 disease targets. |
| **MTHFR** | **A1298C (E429A)** | rs1801131 | **Hetero (TG)** | Conflicting/Uncertain | Regulatory domain -- BH4/neurotransmitter pathway impaired. Anxiety, B-vitamins. |
| **MTRR** | **I22M (c.66A>G)** | rs1801394 | **Hetero (AG)** | Likely Pathogenic | B12 metabolism cofactor -- compounds the MTHFR methylation defect (triple-hit). |

## Primary Experimental Indication Hypotheses

The computational findings in this project generate specific, testable hypotheses rather than therapeutic claims. Two downstream systems are prioritized for experimental validation based on existing literature:

### Hypothesis 1: Retinal Pathway

Because MTHFR dysfunction has been linked in prior literature to homocysteine-related retinal injury, the retina is a candidate downstream system for validation. The current computational results do not establish efficacy in retinal disease, but they support testing whether high-risk MTHFR states are associated with measurable retinal biomarkers.

**Supporting literature:**
- **Mthfr+/- mice** show 2x retinal homocysteine, ~20% ganglion cell loss, thinner nerve fiber layer, and vascular leakage -- without elevated IOP (Markand et al., 2015, *IOVS*)
- **Case report:** metabolic correction with betaine was associated with visual recovery in a patient with severe MTHFR deficiency (Hergert et al., 2022, *J Neurology*)
- **Retinal perfusion improved** by MTHFR genotype-guided supplementation; compound C677T/A1298C carriers showed significant improvement (Jiang et al., 2023, *Clin Ophthalmol*)
- MTHFR modifies CRB1-related retinopathies, worsening rd8 retinal phenotype (Markand et al., 2015, *Exp Eye Res*)

**Proposed validation:** Correlate MTHFR genotype with retinal OCT measurements, homocysteine levels, and visual acuity in defined patient cohorts.

### Hypothesis 2: Neuropsychiatric Pathway

Because folate cycle dysfunction may influence BH4-dependent neurotransmitter pathways, neuropsychiatric phenotypes are a second candidate area for validation. The current structural data do not establish causation or treatment effect, but they support testing whether selected high-risk MTHFR states correlate with measurable biochemical and clinical features.

**Supporting literature:**
- **MTHFR polymorphism** associated with schizophrenia, major depression, autism, bipolar disorder, and ADHD (Wan et al., 2018, *Transl Psychiatry*)
- Compound heterozygous patients show treatment-responsive anxiety with SAMe and methylated B vitamins when MTHFR status is identified (Levin & Varga, 2016)
- The A1298C variant impairs BH4 recycling -- the cofactor for tryptophan hydroxylase (serotonin) and tyrosine hydroxylase (dopamine)
- MTHFR-related one-carbon pathway alterations may influence BH4-dependent neurotransmitter synthesis, warranting investigation in defined subgroups with biochemical abnormalities

**Proposed validation:** Measure BH4, homocysteine, SAMe/SAH ratio, and neurotransmitter metabolites in compound heterozygous individuals vs. wild-type controls.

---

## Additional Disease Pathways

MTHFR dysfunction extends beyond vision and neuropsychiatry. Correcting the underlying genetic defect could have beneficial effects across these additional pathways. These are documented here for completeness and to support the case for a unified genetic correction strategy.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder and Cerebral Folate Deficiency

Reduced 5-MTHF transport across the blood-brain barrier starves the developing brain of folate. Meta-analysis of 15 studies supports an association between C677T and ASD (Pu et al., 2020). Folinic acid improved verbal communication in ASD children (Frye et al., 2018, *Mol Psychiatry*). Maternal folate supplementation reduces autism risk (Levine, 45,300 children).

### B-Vitamin Processing Failure

B2 cannot regenerate FAD for the already-weakened enzyme; B12 gets trapped in inactive forms; dietary folate cannot convert to active 5-MTHF. Riboflavin supplementation lowers homocysteine specifically in 677TT homozygotes (McNulty et al., 2006, *Circulation*).

### Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke

Every 5 umol/L increase in plasma homocysteine is associated with 20-30% higher coronary artery disease risk. The same vascular injury mechanism affecting the retina occurs throughout the body.

### Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Disruption

MTHFR produces methyl groups used by >200 methyltransferases. Mthfr-deficient male mice show transgenerational loss of sperm DNA methylation persisting across F1 and F2 generations (Karahan et al., 2021). This means MTHFR dysfunction can affect children and grandchildren through epigenetic inheritance.

### Pregnancy Complications and Reproductive Health

MTHFR variants are associated with multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Preeclampsia:** Meta-analysis of 51 studies supports significant association with C677T (Xia et al., 2013)
- **Recurrent pregnancy loss:** A1298C specifically linked to recurrent miscarriage (Kumar et al., 2024, *BMC Pregnancy Childbirth*)
- **Neural tube defects:** MTHFR is the key enzyme in the folate pathway that prevents NTDs; global folic acid fortification was designed partly because of MTHFR variant prevalence
- VTE in pregnancy: 50% of compound heterozygous patients vs 28.6% wild-type (Liew & Gupta, 2015)

**Working hypothesis:** The compound heterozygous MTHFR dimer shows lower predicted confidence for cofactor-associated and substrate-associated interactions relative to wild-type. These results support experimental testing of whether selected high-risk MTHFR states contribute to measurable dysfunction in retinal and neuropsychiatric-relevant pathways, and whether genetic correction could restore enzyme activity toward wild-type levels.

## AlphaFold 3 Structural Predictions

We used [AlphaFold 3 Server](https://alphafoldserver.com) to predict structures of wild-type, C677T, A1298C, and compound heterozygous MTHFR in complex with FAD cofactor.

### Methodology

- **Sequences:** All derived from canonical [UniProt P42898](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P42898/entry) (656 amino acids) with verified mutations at positions 222 and 429
- **Predictions:** 16 jobs total -- monomers, homodimers, heterodimers, with FAD, THF (folate substrate), and SAM (allosteric inhibitor)
- **Replication:** Each core prediction run with independent random seeds for statistical comparison
- **Upload-ready JSON files** included in `alphafold/jobs/json/` for one-click replication

### Job Design

| 05 | A1298C (E429A) | Monomer + FAD | Regulatory domain variant |
| 06 | Compound + WT | Heterodimer + FAD | Compound heterozygous (author's genotype) |
| 07-12 | All variants | Same as 01-06 | Replication with independent seeds |
| 13-15 | WT, C677T, Compound | Dimer + FAD + THF | Substrate binding comparison |
| 16 | Wild-type | Dimer + FAD + SAM | Allosteric inhibitor binding |

### AlphaFold 3 Results (March 2026)

#### Monomer Predictions

| Job | Variant | pTM | ipTM (FAD) | FAD Binding | pLDDT@222 | pLDDT@429 |

| 12 | **Compound dimer rep** | **0.76** | **0.73** | **0.55** | **96.4** | **95.3** |

#### Summary: Averaged Across Replicates

| Variant | Avg pTM | Avg ipTM | Avg FAD Binding | Avg pLDDT@222 | Avg pLDDT@429 |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **WT dimer** | 0.775 | 0.740 | 0.555 | 97.3 | 96.0 |
| **C677T dimer** | 0.785 | 0.765 | 0.575 | 97.05 | 95.95 |
| **Compound dimer** | **0.745** | **0.715** | **0.540** | **96.5** | **95.15** |

**Key observations (replicated across independent seeds):**
- **Monomer predictions show all variants fold correctly** (ipTM 0.97-0.98) -- the mutations do not destroy the protein fold
- **Dimer predictions reveal inter-chain effects** -- FAD binding confidence drops from 0.97 (monomer) to 0.53-0.58 (dimer), consistent with known cooperativity in the homodimer
- **The compound heterozygous dimer shows the weakest predicted interaction profile** across every metric in both runs: pTM (0.73/0.76), ipTM (0.70/0.73), FAD binding (0.53/0.55), pLDDT@429 (95.0/95.3)
- **Compound het dimer averages lower than either single variant** -- ipTM 0.715 vs WT 0.740 and C677T 0.765, suggesting synergistic destabilization
- **Results replicate** -- independent random seeds produce consistent trends, supporting the reproducibility of these observations
- **Position 429 (A1298C site) shows the largest confidence drop in compound dimers** -- pLDDT 95.0-95.3 vs 95.8-96.2 in WT, suggesting regulatory domain perturbation at the dimer level

> **The core scientific observation:** Monomer predictions show all variants fold correctly, but dimer predictions reveal inter-chain effects. This is the finding to build around.

> **Important:** These are computational predictions, not experimental structures. All confidence metrics should be interpreted as hypothesis generators, not proof of mechanism. See the [full research paper draft](docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_DRAFT.md) for complete methodology and limitations.

## What the Research Shows

### Key Finding: Structural Context for MTHFR Variants

The 2024 cryo-EM structures (PDB 8QA5, 8QA6) revealed for the first time how SAM-mediated allosteric inhibition works through **dual SAM binding** that reorients the catalytic domain and blocks substrate access. This provides critical structural context for understanding the A1298C (E429A) variant, which sits in the regulatory domain near the SAM-binding pocket.

The 2006 structural perturbation study (Pejchal et al.) showed that the C677T (A222V) variant displaces **helix alpha-5**, which carries three FAD-interacting residues (Asn168, Arg171, Lys172). This is consistent with the observed thermolability -- the variant enzyme may have reduced FAD cofactor stability at physiological temperature.

### The MTRR Compounding Effect

The author also carries MTRR I22M (rs1801394), which impairs B12 regeneration -- the enzyme immediately downstream of MTHFR. This creates a **triple-hit** to the methylation cycle: less substrate produced (MTHFR), impaired regulation (A1298C), AND less-functional downstream cofactor (MTRR). This may explain why some compound heterozygous individuals are more severely affected than others.

### Therapeutic Precedent: Base Editing Is Working in Humans

| Program | Company | Target | Delivery | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| VERVE-102 | Verve Therapeutics | PCSK9 (single base edit) | IV LNP | Phase 1b |
| Beam-101 | Beam Therapeutics | Sickle cell (base edit) | Ex vivo | Phase I/II |
| Casgevy | Vertex/CRISPR | Sickle cell / beta-thal | Ex vivo | **FDA Approved (2023)** |
| YOLT-101 | YolTech | PCSK9 (next-gen ABE) | IV LNP | Phase 1 -- good safety (2025) |

The C677T variant (T>C at DNA level) is a candidate for **adenine base editing (ABE)**, which converts A-T base pairs to G-C base pairs -- the same mechanism used by VERVE-102 and YOLT-101 currently in clinical trials.

## Safety Architecture: What If Something Goes Wrong?

Any gene therapy must answer this question. We propose a multi-layered safety approach:

| Layer | Mechanism | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **1. Inherent safety** | Base editing has no DNA breaks; LNP mRNA degrades in 48 hours; restores wild-type (not novel) protein | Built into platform |
| **2. Guide RNA screening** | Comprehensive off-target analysis before treatment (Cas-OFFinder, GUIDE-seq, whole-genome sequencing) | Standard practice |
| **3. Anti-CRISPR off-switch** | Emergency LNP dose carrying anti-CRISPR proteins (AcrIIA4) to neutralize any residual editor | Demonstrated in mice |
| **4. CRISPRoff reversible option** | Epigenetic silencing as a reversible "test run" before permanent editing; reversed with TET1 demethylase | Moving to clinical (2025) |
| **5. Post-treatment monitoring** | Homocysteine, methylation panels, retinal OCT, off-target sequencing at defined timepoints | Clinical protocol |

**Key point:** The C677T correction restores the ancestral wild-type protein sequence. We are not creating a novel protein -- we are restoring the reference allele.

See the [full research paper](docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_DRAFT.md#47-safety-architecture-built-in-safeguards-and-emergency-off-switches) for complete safety analysis.

## Development Roadmap

From computational observations to experimental validation -- here's the path forward:

| Phase | What | Timeline | Cost | Status |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|
| **1** | Computational target validation -- AlphaFold/Boltz-2 structural analysis, reproducible pipeline, open-source repo | **Done** | **$0** | ✅ **Complete** |
| **2** | Structural validation against PDB 6FCX, molecular dynamics simulations, bioRxiv preprint, researcher outreach | 1-3 months | ~$500 | Next |
| **3** | Biochemical validation -- express WT/variant proteins, dimer stability assays, FAD/THF cofactor binding assays | 6-12 months | $50K-150K | Needs lab partner |
| **4** | Subgroup biomarker correlation -- homocysteine, methylation panels, retinal OCT, BH4 levels in defined compound het cohorts | 12-18 months | $100K-300K | Needs clinical collaborator |
| **5** | If biochemical + biomarker data support: ABE guide RNA design, editing feasibility in cell lines | 18-24 months | $200K-500K | Needs gene editing lab |
| **6** | If editing feasibility confirmed: preclinical animal studies (Mthfr+/- mice, multi-organ endpoints) | 24-36 months | $500K-2M | Needs institution |
| **7** | If preclinical success: IND filing, clinical trial design, regulatory pathway | 3-7+ years | $5M+ | Needs biotech/pharma |

**Where we are now:** Phase 1 complete. The computational foundation exists. Every sequence, every prediction, every analysis, every reference -- documented and replicable. Built for $0.

**The critical next step:** Get a researcher with a wet lab to say "yes." Everything in this repo is designed to make that conversation happen.

## How You Can Help

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions.

**If you're a scientist:** We're focused on two primary targets -- retinal neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric disorders -- because these have the strongest preclinical evidence and clearest path to clinical trials. We believe the structural data may have broader implications, but we're choosing to focus where the science is strongest. [Open an issue](../../issues/new?template=collaboration.md) or email me.

**What we're looking for:**
- **Ophthalmologists / Retinal researchers:** Validate the retinal neurodegeneration pathway. Existing Mthfr+/- mouse models show ganglion cell loss -- can we test base editing correction via intravitreal delivery?
- **Psychiatrists / Neuroscientists:** Could A1298C/BH4/neurotransmitter pathway alterations be a contributing factor in defined subgroups with psychiatric symptoms and biochemical abnormalities? Is this mechanism well-characterized enough for experimental investigation?
- **Structural biologists:** Are the AlphaFold/Boltz-2 predictions biologically sensible? Cryo-EM of C677T/A1298C variants with FAD would validate or refute our computational findings
- **Gene therapy researchers:** Base editor guide RNA design and testing for C677T correction in cell lines
- **Replication:** Independent researchers reproducing and extending the computational analysis

**If you're not a scientist:** Share this project. Get tested for MTHFR. Tell your doctor about it. The more people who know, the more pressure there is to take this seriously.

*I'm not a doctor. I'm not a biohacker. I'm a cybersecurity guy and cloud architect who looked at his DNA results, started asking questions, and used AI tools to organize what I found. I don't have a lab. I don't have a PhD. I'm just someone who thinks outside the box.*

*I believe this data could be important for people losing their vision and people struggling with anxiety and depression that doesn't respond to standard treatment. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong -- I'm not qualified to say. But the structural predictions are real, the references are verified, and the analysis is replicable. I built this project to hand it to the real scientists who can take it further.*

*We're focusing on retinal neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric disorders because these seem to have the strongest evidence and the clearest path to clinical trials -- existing mouse models, proven delivery routes, documented human case reversals. I think so, at least. I'm not a doctor. But the data is here for anyone who is.*

*If you're a researcher who can validate this, please reach out. If you're someone losing their vision or living with unexplained anxiety -- get tested for MTHFR. Know your status. It might explain everything.*

*I want to help future generations not have to go through what so many people are going through right now.*
