# MTHFR Variant Target Validation Program

### Computational Prioritization of High-Risk MTHFR Variant States for Experimental Validation

> This project is a computational hypothesis-prioritization study designed to identify experimentally testable differences among wild-type, single-variant, and compound heterozygous MTHFR states. In the tested AlphaFold 3 and Boltz-2 model configurations, the compound heterozygous dimer produced the lowest reported interaction-confidence values across the assessed dimer-interface and ligand-associated metrics relative to the tested wild-type and single-variant comparators. These observations do not establish mechanism, disease causation, or therapeutic benefit. They support a bounded experimental agenda centered on dimer-level biology, retinal biomarkers, and neuropsychiatric biochemical readouts.
>
> **Core observation:** Monomer predictions show preserved overall folding across the tested variant states, whereas dimer predictions show inter-chain differences. This is the central finding of the current study.

## About the Author

My name is Igor Mihaljko. I come from outside biomedical research -- I'm a cybersecurity specialist and cloud architect with 20+ years in IT. I approached this as a structured computational investigation after discovering I carry compound heterozygous MTHFR variants (C677T + A1298C).

When I started researching what this means, I found literature spanning multiple disease categories and built this project to synthesize that literature alongside structural predictions in one open framework. I built this as an open starting point for researchers who want to evaluate these questions experimentally. The sequences, protocols, and analysis pipeline are included for replication and critique.

See [FOUNDERS_NOTE.md](FOUNDERS_NOTE.md) for the full story behind this project.

## A Cross-Specialty Problem That May Be Underintegrated in Current Research

MTHFR dysfunction has been studied extensively within individual medical specialties -- ophthalmology, psychiatry, neurology, cardiology, nutrition, reproductive medicine, and genetics. However, these investigations have largely proceeded in parallel rather than as an integrated body of evidence.

This project attempts to bring the structural biology perspective into that conversation. We do not claim to have connected dots that others missed -- we are synthesizing published literature and adding computational structural data to support experimental prioritization.

### Possible Reasons MTHFR Has Not Yet Advanced as a Gene Editing Program

As of March 2026, we did not identify a registered interventional clinical trial focused on MTHFR gene editing in ClinicalTrials.gov searches. This absence should not be interpreted as evidence of scientific disinterest or target invalidity. Several factors may contribute:

| Observation | Context |
|-------------|---------|
| Common variant, not classic disease gene | High population prevalence has led these variants to be framed as common polymorphisms rather than direct interventional targets |
| Supplementation available | Methylfolate, riboflavin, B12 partially compensate, reducing perceived urgency for genetic correction |
| Cross-specialty fragmentation | Relevant disease associations span 7+ specialties; no single field owns the integrated picture |
| Structural data only recently available | First human MTHFR crystal structure 2018 (PDB 6FCX), cryo-EM 2024 (PDB 8QA5, 8QA6) |
| Gene editing precedent emerging | Human base-editing programs show that precise in vivo correction strategies are feasible for selected targets, though target biology, delivery, benefit-risk, and regulatory path remain highly target-specific |

**Why this question is now technically more testable:** Recent advances in structure prediction, human base-editing programs for other targets, scalable nucleic acid delivery systems, and new human MTHFR structural data make experimental assessment of MTHFR correction more technically discussable than before. They do not establish MTHFR as a therapeutic target. This project asks whether these conditions warrant a bounded experimental investigation.

## The MTHFR Enzyme

**MTHFR** (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, EC 1.5.1.20) is a FAD-dependent homodimeric enzyme that converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate -- the primary circulating form of folate and the methyl donor for converting homocysteine to methionine.

### Known Structures

| PDB | Year | Method | Resolution | What It Shows |
|-----|------|--------|------------|---------------|
| [6FCX](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6FCX) | 2018 | X-ray | 2.5 A | First human MTHFR crystal structure -- homodimer with catalytic TIM-barrel + regulatory SAM-binding domain (Froese et al., *Nat Commun*) |
| [8QA5](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8QA5) | 2024 | Cryo-EM | -- | MTHFR + SAH dis-inhibited (active) state -- single SAH bound, catalytic domain flexible (Froese et al., *Nat Commun*) |
| [8QA6](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8QA6) | 2024 | Cryo-EM | -- | MTHFR + SAM inhibited state -- dual SAM binding reorients catalytic domain, blocks substrate access |

### The Two Key Variants

| Variant | rsID | Position | Domain | Mechanism | Population Frequency |
|---------|------|----------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **C677T (A222V)** | [rs1801133](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?term=rs1801133) | 222 (catalytic) | FAD-binding TIM-barrel | Displaces helix alpha-5, disrupting FAD-interacting residues Asn168, Arg171, Lys172. Creates thermolabile enzyme. ~35% activity loss per allele. | 24-50% (varies by ethnicity) |
| **A1298C (E429A)** | [rs1801131](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?term=rs1801131) | 429 (regulatory) | SAM-binding domain | Has been discussed in relation to BH4-related pathways and lies near the regulatory region implicated by 2024 cryo-EM structures. Reported ~30% activity reduction per allele. | ~25% European |

**Compound heterozygosity** has been reported to reduce overall enzyme activity relative to wild-type in prior literature, with effects that may involve both catalytic and regulatory context.

## Primary Experimental Indication Hypotheses

The computational findings in this project generate specific, testable hypotheses rather than therapeutic claims. Two downstream systems are prioritized for experimental validation based on existing literature:

### Hypothesis 1: Retinal Pathway

Because MTHFR dysfunction has been linked in prior literature to homocysteine-related retinal injury, the retina is a candidate downstream system for validation. The current computational results do not establish efficacy in retinal disease, but they support testing whether high-risk MTHFR states are associated with measurable retinal biomarkers.

**Supporting literature:**
- **Mthfr+/- mice** show 2x retinal homocysteine, ~20% ganglion cell loss, thinner nerve fiber layer, and vascular leakage -- without elevated IOP (Markand et al., 2015, *IOVS*)
- **Case report:** metabolic correction with betaine was associated with visual recovery in a patient with severe MTHFR deficiency (Hergert et al., 2022, *J Neurology*)
- **Retinal perfusion improved** by MTHFR genotype-guided supplementation; compound C677T/A1298C carriers showed significant improvement (Jiang et al., 2023, *Clin Ophthalmol*)
- MTHFR modifies CRB1-related retinopathies, worsening rd8 retinal phenotype (Markand et al., 2015, *Exp Eye Res*)

**Proposed validation:** Correlate MTHFR genotype with retinal OCT measurements, homocysteine levels, and visual acuity in defined patient cohorts.

### Hypothesis 2: Neuropsychiatric Pathway

Because folate cycle dysfunction may influence BH4-dependent neurotransmitter pathways, neuropsychiatric phenotypes are a second candidate area for validation. The current structural data do not establish causation or treatment effect, but they support testing whether selected high-risk MTHFR states correlate with measurable biochemical and clinical features.

**Supporting literature:**
- **MTHFR polymorphism** associated with schizophrenia, major depression, autism, bipolar disorder, and ADHD (Wan et al., 2018, *Transl Psychiatry*)
- Compound heterozygous patients show treatment-responsive anxiety with SAMe and methylated B vitamins when MTHFR status is identified (Levin & Varga, 2016)
- A1298C has been discussed in relation to BH4-relevant pathways in the literature, but the mechanism, effect size, and subgroup specificity remain incompletely defined
- MTHFR-related one-carbon pathway alterations may influence BH4-dependent neurotransmitter synthesis, warranting investigation in defined subgroups with biochemical abnormalities

**Proposed validation:** Measure BH4, homocysteine, SAMe/SAH ratio, and neurotransmitter metabolites in compound heterozygous individuals vs. wild-type controls.

---

## Additional Disease Pathways

MTHFR dysfunction has been associated with additional disease-relevant pathways in the literature. If future biochemical and in vivo studies support a causal contribution of selected high-risk MTHFR states, genetic correction could be evaluated as one possible upstream intervention strategy. These pathways are documented here for completeness.

Published literature has also reported MTHFR associations with autism/cerebral folate deficiency (Pu et al., 2020; Frye et al., 2018), B-vitamin processing failure (McNulty et al., 2006), cardiovascular disease via homocysteine elevation, transgenerational epigenetic effects in mouse models (Karahan et al., 2021), and adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia (Xia et al., 2013) and recurrent pregnancy loss (Kumar et al., 2024). These are documented in the [full research paper](docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_DRAFT.md) but are not the primary focus of this computational study.

**Working hypothesis:** The compound heterozygous MTHFR dimer shows lower predicted confidence for cofactor-associated and substrate-associated interactions relative to wild-type. These results support experimental testing of whether selected high-risk MTHFR states contribute to measurable dysfunction in retinal and neuropsychiatric-relevant pathways, and whether genetic correction could theoretically modulate enzyme activity relative to wild-type, contingent on experimental validation.

## AlphaFold 3 Structural Predictions

We used [AlphaFold 3 Server](https://alphafoldserver.com) to predict structures of wild-type, C677T, A1298C, and compound heterozygous MTHFR in complex with FAD cofactor.

### Methodology

- **Sequences:** All derived from canonical [UniProt P42898](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P42898/entry) (656 amino acids) with verified mutations at positions 222 and 429
- **Predictions:** 16 jobs total -- monomers, homodimers, heterodimers, with FAD, THF (folate substrate), and SAM (allosteric inhibitor)
- **Replication:** Each core prediction run with independent random seeds for statistical comparison
- **Upload-ready JSON files** included in `alphafold/jobs/json/` for one-click replication

### Job Design

| 05 | A1298C (E429A) | Monomer + FAD | Regulatory domain variant |
| 06 | Compound + WT | Heterodimer + FAD | Compound heterozygous (author's genotype) |
| 07-12 | All variants | Same as 01-06 | Replication with independent seeds |
| 13-15 | WT, C677T, Compound | Dimer + FAD + THF | Substrate binding comparison |
| 16 | Wild-type | Dimer + FAD + SAM | Allosteric inhibitor binding |

### AlphaFold 3 Results (March 2026)

#### Monomer Predictions

| Job | Variant | pTM | ipTM (FAD) | FAD Binding | pLDDT@222 | pLDDT@429 |

| 11 | **A1298C rep** | 0.81 | 0.97 | 0.97 | 98.4 | 97.5 |

#### Dimer Predictions -- Where the Real Differences Emerge (All 12 Jobs Complete, Replicated)

| Job | Variant | pTM | ipTM | FAD Binding | pLDDT@222 | pLDDT@429 |
|-----|---------|-----|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| 02 | **WT dimer** | 0.79 | 0.76 | 0.57 | 97.4 | 96.2 |
| 08 | **WT dimer rep** | 0.76 | 0.72 | 0.54 | 97.2 | 95.8 |

| 06 | **Compound dimer (AUTHOR'S GENOTYPE)** | **0.73** | **0.70** | **0.53** | **96.6** | **95.0** |
| 12 | **Compound dimer rep** | **0.76** | **0.73** | **0.55** | **96.4** | **95.3** |

#### Summary: Averaged Across Replicates

| Variant | Avg pTM | Avg ipTM | Avg FAD Binding | Avg pLDDT@222 | Avg pLDDT@429 |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **WT dimer** | 0.775 | 0.740 | 0.555 | 97.3 | 96.0 |
| **C677T dimer** | 0.785 | 0.765 | 0.575 | 97.05 | 95.95 |
| **Compound dimer** | **0.745** | **0.715** | **0.540** | **96.5** | **95.15** |

**Key observations (replicated across independent seeds):**
- **Monomer predictions show all variants fold correctly** (ipTM 0.97-0.98) -- the mutations do not destroy the protein fold
- **Dimer predictions reveal inter-chain effects** -- FAD binding confidence drops from 0.97 (monomer) to 0.53-0.58 (dimer), consistent with known cooperativity in the homodimer
- **The compound heterozygous dimer shows the weakest predicted interaction profile** across every metric in both runs: pTM (0.73/0.76), ipTM (0.70/0.73), FAD binding (0.53/0.55), pLDDT@429 (95.0/95.3)
- **Compound heterozygous dimers averaged lower than the tested comparators** -- ipTM 0.715 vs WT 0.740 and C677T 0.765, consistent with a possible combined destabilizing effect at the dimer level
- **Results replicate** -- independent random seeds produce consistent trends, supporting the reproducibility of these observations
- **Position 429 showed the largest confidence decrease** among the reported local metrics in compound dimers -- pLDDT 95.0-95.3 vs 95.8-96.2 in WT, consistent with possible regulatory-domain involvement at the dimer level

> **The core scientific observation:** Monomer predictions show all variants fold correctly, but dimer predictions reveal inter-chain effects. This is the finding to build around.

> **Important:** These are computational predictions, not experimental structures. All confidence metrics should be interpreted as hypothesis generators, not proof of mechanism. See the [full research paper draft](docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_DRAFT.md) for complete methodology and limitations.

## What the Research Shows

### Key Finding: Structural Context for MTHFR Variants

The 2024 cryo-EM structures (PDB 8QA5, 8QA6) revealed for the first time how SAM-mediated allosteric inhibition works through **dual SAM binding** that reorients the catalytic domain and blocks substrate access. This provides critical structural context for understanding the A1298C (E429A) variant, which sits in the regulatory domain near the SAM-binding pocket.

The 2006 structural perturbation study (Pejchal et al.) showed that the C677T (A222V) variant displaces **helix alpha-5**, which carries three FAD-interacting residues (Asn168, Arg171, Lys172). This is consistent with the observed thermolability -- the variant enzyme may have reduced FAD cofactor stability at physiological temperature.

### The MTRR Compounding Effect

The author also carries MTRR I22M (rs1801394), which is involved in B12 regeneration -- the enzyme immediately downstream of MTHFR. This combination could place additive pressure on one-carbon metabolism by affecting upstream folate handling and downstream B12-dependent recycling. Whether this co-occurrence contributes to phenotypic variability among compound heterozygous individuals warrants investigation.

### Therapeutic Precedent: Base Editing Is Working in Humans

| Program | Company | Target | Delivery | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| VERVE-102 | Verve Therapeutics | PCSK9 (single base edit) | IV LNP | Phase 1b |
| Beam-101 | Beam Therapeutics | Sickle cell (base edit) | Ex vivo | Phase I/II |
| Casgevy | Vertex/CRISPR | Sickle cell / beta-thal | Ex vivo | **FDA Approved (2023)** |
| YOLT-101 | YolTech | PCSK9 (next-gen ABE) | IV LNP | Phase 1 -- good safety (2025) |

At the sequence level, C677T appears conceptually compatible with **adenine base editing (ABE)** logic, which converts A-T base pairs to G-C base pairs. However, edit window, guide design, bystander edits, tissue targeting, and functional rescue would all need empirical validation.

---

## Safety Architecture: What If Something Goes Wrong?

Any future gene editing program would need to address safety. The following are examples of safety layers used or discussed in broader editing research that could be relevant to MTHFR correction if it advances to experimental testing. Each would require target-specific validation.

| Layer | Concept | Precedent |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **1. Inherent design** | Base editing avoids DNA double-strand breaks; LNP-delivered mRNA degrades within 48 hours | Used in VERVE-102, BEAM-101 |
| **2. Off-target screening** | Cas-OFFinder, GUIDE-seq, whole-genome sequencing before any intervention | Standard in current editing programs |
| **3. Anti-CRISPR proteins** | Emergency neutralization of residual editor activity (e.g., AcrIIA4) | Demonstrated in preclinical models |
| **4. Reversible epigenetic editing** | CRISPRoff as a non-permanent first step before committing to base editing | In early translational development |
| **5. Post-intervention monitoring** | Biomarker panels, off-target sequencing at defined timepoints | Standard clinical protocol design |

**Key point:** At the target base, a successful correction strategy would aim to restore the reference allele sequence rather than introduce a novel coding change.

See the [full research paper](docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_DRAFT.md#47-safety-architecture-built-in-safeguards-and-emergency-off-switches) for complete safety analysis.

## Development Roadmap

From computational observations to experimental validation -- here's the path forward:

| Phase | What | Timeline | Cost | Status |
|-------|------|----------|------|--------|
| **1** | Computational target validation -- AlphaFold/Boltz-2 structural analysis, reproducible pipeline, open-source repo | **Done** | **$0** | ✅ **Complete** |
| **2** | Structural validation against PDB 6FCX, molecular dynamics simulations, bioRxiv preprint, researcher outreach | 1-3 months | ~$500 | Next |
| **3** | Biochemical validation -- express WT/variant proteins, dimer stability assays, FAD/THF cofactor binding assays | 6-12 months | $50K-150K | Needs lab partner |
| **4** | Subgroup biomarker correlation -- homocysteine, methylation panels, retinal OCT, BH4 levels in defined compound het cohorts | 12-18 months | $100K-300K | Needs clinical collaborator |
| **5** | If biochemical + biomarker data support: ABE guide RNA design, editing feasibility in cell lines | 18-24 months | $200K-500K | Needs gene editing lab |
| **6** | If editing feasibility confirmed: preclinical animal studies (Mthfr+/- mice, multi-organ endpoints) | 24-36 months | $500K-2M | Needs institution |
| **7** | If preclinical success: IND filing, clinical trial design, regulatory pathway | 3-7+ years | $5M+ | Needs biotech/pharma |

**Where we are now:** Phase 1 complete. The computational foundation exists. Every sequence, every prediction, every analysis, every reference -- documented and replicable. Built for $0.

**The critical next step:** Get a researcher with a wet lab to say "yes." Everything in this repo is designed to make that conversation happen.

## How You Can Help

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions.

**If you're a scientist:** Our structural and literature synthesis supports a bounded experimental program centered on dimer-level effects, retinal biomarkers, and neuropsychiatric biochemistry. We are choosing to focus where the existing literature is most developed. [Open an issue](../../issues/new?template=collaboration.md) or email me.

**What we're looking for:**
- **Ophthalmologists / Retinal researchers:** Existing Mthfr+/- mouse models provide one possible system for testing whether correction strategies alter retinal biomarkers. Delivery route, tissue targeting, and edit feasibility would need separate evaluation
- **Psychiatrists / Neuroscientists:** Could A1298C-related one-carbon pathway alterations be a contributing factor in defined subgroups with biochemical abnormalities? The mechanism and subgroup specificity remain incompletely defined
- **Structural biologists:** Are the AlphaFold/Boltz-2 predictions biologically sensible? Cryo-EM of C677T/A1298C variants with FAD would provide orthogonal validation
- **Gene editing researchers:** Evaluate whether C677T is technically tractable for guide design, edit-window fit, bystander risk assessment, and cell-based rescue studies
- **Replication:** Independent researchers reproducing and extending the computational analysis

**If you're not a scientist:** Share this project with researchers who might find it useful. If you are a patient or family member, discuss any testing or interpretation questions with a qualified clinician.

*I'm not a doctor. I'm not a biohacker. I'm a cybersecurity guy and cloud architect who looked at his DNA results, started asking questions, and used AI tools to organize what I found. I don't have a lab. I don't have a PhD. I built this project to hand it to the real scientists who can take it further.*

*The structural predictions are reproducible, the references are verified, and the analysis pipeline is open source. I'm not qualified to say whether these computational differences are biologically meaningful -- but I've tried to make it as easy as possible for someone who is qualified to find out.*

*If you are a clinician or researcher, I hope this project helps define a tractable experimental path. If you are a patient or family member, this project should be read as a research document, not as medical guidance. Variant status needs clinical interpretation in context with symptoms, labs, and the broader medical picture.*

*I want to help future generations not have to go through what so many people are going through right now.*
