## Who I Am (And Who I Am Not)

**I'm not a biohacker. I'm not trying to be something I'm not.**

My name is Igor Mihaljko. I'm a cybersecurity specialist, cloud solution architect, and infrastructure architect with 20+ years in IT and 14 Microsoft certifications. I run an AI marketing agency called DSM.Promo in Chicago.

I'm just a guy who thinks outside the box. I looked at my genetic test results, started asking questions that crossed the boundaries between medical specialties, and used AI tools to organize what I found. This project exists because I believe the next generation deserves better -- and sometimes it takes someone from outside a field to see what the people inside it can't.

**This project started with my own DNA.** I discovered I carry compound heterozygous MTHFR mutations (C677T + A1298C). When I started researching what this means, I found that the same broken enzyme is connected to five major disease categories -- and nobody had put the full picture together in one place.

I built this project to hand it to the real scientists. Everything is here -- the sequences, the protocols, the analysis pipeline. Take it. Build on it. Prove me wrong or prove me right.

## The Problem Nobody Connected

Modern medicine is organized by organ system. Ophthalmologists treat eyes. Psychiatrists treat anxiety. Neurologists study autism. Cardiologists manage heart disease. Nutritionists advise on B-vitamins.

**Nobody steps back to see that the same broken enzyme -- MTHFR -- feeds all five problems.**

Thousands of papers have been published on individual aspects of MTHFR. But no single document connects all five disease pathways to one genetic root cause and proposes a unified correction strategy using modern structural biology tools. That's what this project does.

## The MTHFR Enzyme

**MTHFR** (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, EC 1.5.1.20) is a FAD-dependent homodimeric enzyme that converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate -- the primary circulating form of folate and the methyl donor for converting homocysteine to methionine.

### Known Structures

| PDB | Year | Method | Resolution | What It Shows |
|-----|------|--------|------------|---------------|
| [6FCX](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6FCX) | 2018 | X-ray | 2.5 A | First human MTHFR crystal structure -- homodimer with catalytic TIM-barrel + regulatory SAM-binding domain (Froese et al., *Nat Commun*) |
| [8QA5](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8QA5) | 2024 | Cryo-EM | -- | MTHFR + SAH dis-inhibited (active) state -- single SAH bound, catalytic domain flexible (Froese et al., *Nat Commun*) |
| [8QA6](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8QA6) | 2024 | Cryo-EM | -- | MTHFR + SAM inhibited state -- dual SAM binding reorients catalytic domain, blocks substrate access |

### The Two Key Variants

| Variant | rsID | Position | Domain | Mechanism | Population Frequency |
|---------|------|----------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **C677T (A222V)** | [rs1801133](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?term=rs1801133) | 222 (catalytic) | FAD-binding TIM-barrel | Displaces helix alpha-5, disrupting FAD-interacting residues Asn168, Arg171, Lys172. Creates thermolabile enzyme. ~35% activity loss per allele. | 24-50% (varies by ethnicity) |
| **A1298C (E429A)** | [rs1801131](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/?term=rs1801131) | 429 (regulatory) | SAM-binding domain | Near the SAM-binding pocket identified in 2024 cryo-EM structures. Impairs BH4 recycling. ~30% activity loss per allele. | ~25% European |

**Compound heterozygosity** (one copy of each) produces ~50-60% of normal enzyme activity -- a dual hit affecting both catalytic function and regulatory feedback simultaneously.

---

## My Genetic Variants

| Gene | Variant | rsID | Zygosity | Classification | Relevance |
|------|---------|------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **MTHFR** | **C677T (A222V)** | rs1801133 | **Hetero (AG)** | Clinically Significant | Catalytic domain -- FAD cofactor binding destabilized. All 5 disease targets. |
| **MTHFR** | **A1298C (E429A)** | rs1801131 | **Hetero (TG)** | Conflicting/Uncertain | Regulatory domain -- BH4/neurotransmitter pathway impaired. Anxiety, B-vitamins. |
| **MTRR** | **I22M (c.66A>G)** | rs1801394 | **Hetero (AG)** | Likely Pathogenic | B12 metabolism cofactor -- compounds the MTHFR methylation defect. |

> **Voluntary Disclosure:** I am sharing my genetic variant data voluntarily because I believe transparency strengthens this research. This is my personal decision. You should never feel pressured to share your genetic information publicly. If you want to contribute your own data to this project, you can do so anonymously.

## The Five Disease Pathways

When MTHFR is impaired, five pathological cascades activate simultaneously:

### Target 1: Vision Loss and Retinal Neurodegeneration

Elevated homocysteine damages retinal ganglion cells through oxidative stress, independent of intraocular pressure.

- **Mthfr+/- mice** show 2x retinal homocysteine, ~20% ganglion cell loss, thinner nerve fiber layer, and vascular leakage (Markand et al., 2015, *IOVS*)
- **Complete blindness reversed** with betaine treatment in severe late-onset MTHFR deficiency (Hergert et al., 2022, *J Neurology*)
- **Retinal perfusion improved** by MTHFR genotype-guided supplementation with Ocufolin medical food; compound C677T/A1298C carriers showed significant improvement (Jiang et al., 2023, *Clin Ophthalmol*)
- MTHFR modifies CRB1-related retinopathies, worsening rd8 retinal phenotype (Markand et al., 2015, *Exp Eye Res*)

### Target 2: Autism Spectrum Disorder and Cerebral Folate Deficiency

Reduced 5-MTHF transport across the blood-brain barrier via Folate Receptor Alpha starves the developing brain of folate.

- **Meta-analysis of 15 studies:** C677T significantly associated with ASD across all five genetic models (Pu et al., 2020, *BMC Pediatrics*)
- **Randomized controlled trial:** Folinic acid improved verbal communication in ASD children with language impairment (Frye et al., 2018, *Mol Psychiatry*)
- Chinese Han study: 677TT genotype 2x more prevalent in autistic children (16.1% vs 8.6%, OR=2.04)
- Maternal folate supplementation before/during pregnancy reduces autism risk (Levine, 45,300 children)

### Target 3: Anxiety, Depression, and Neuropsychiatric Disorders

Impaired SAMe production reduces serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and GABA synthesis. The A1298C variant specifically impairs BH4 recycling -- the rate-limiting cofactor for neurotransmitter hydroxylases.

- **Comprehensive review:** MTHFR polymorphism impacts schizophrenia, major depression, autism, bipolar disorder, and ADHD (Wan et al., 2018, *Transl Psychiatry*)
- Compound heterozygous patients show treatment-responsive anxiety with SAMe and methylated B vitamins (Levin & Varga, 2016)
- Stress amplification loop: stress consumes methyl groups, depleting already-limited methylation, worsening anxiety

### Target 4: B-Vitamin Processing Failure

MTHFR dysfunction creates a cascade: B2 cannot regenerate FAD for the already-weakened enzyme; B12 gets trapped in inactive forms; dietary folate cannot convert to active 5-MTHF.

- **Riboflavin (B2) supplementation** lowers homocysteine specifically in 677TT homozygotes by stabilizing FAD binding (McNulty et al., 2006, *Circulation*)
- The C677T variant has reduced FAD affinity; increased cellular FAD from riboflavin can partially compensate (Pejchal et al., 2006, *Biochemistry*)

### Target 5: Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke

Every 5 umol/L increase in plasma homocysteine is associated with 20-30% higher coronary artery disease risk and 60% elevated stroke risk.

- Homocysteine triggers endothelial dysfunction through oxidative damage -- the same vascular injury mechanism affecting the retina
- B-vitamin supplementation reduces homocysteine but clinical trial results on CVD outcomes remain debated

**The thesis:** One CRISPR base editing correction of MTHFR could address all five pathways through a single genetic intervention.

## AlphaFold 3 Structural Predictions

We used [AlphaFold 3 Server](https://alphafoldserver.com) to predict structures of wild-type, C677T, A1298C, and compound heterozygous MTHFR in complex with FAD cofactor.

### Methodology

- **Sequences:** All derived from canonical [UniProt P42898](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P42898/entry) (656 amino acids) with verified mutations at positions 222 and 429
- **Predictions:** 16 jobs total -- monomers, homodimers, heterodimers, with FAD, THF (folate substrate), and SAM (allosteric inhibitor)
- **Replication:** Each core prediction run with independent random seeds for statistical comparison
- **Upload-ready JSON files** included in `alphafold/jobs/json/` for one-click replication

### Job Design

| Jobs | Protein | Configuration | Purpose |
|------|---------|--------------|---------|
| 01-02 | Wild-type | Monomer + Dimer + FAD | Baseline |
| 03-04 | C677T (A222V) | Monomer + Dimer + FAD | Catalytic domain variant |
| 05 | A1298C (E429A) | Monomer + FAD | Regulatory domain variant |
| 06 | Compound + WT | Heterodimer + FAD | Compound heterozygous (author's genotype) |
| 07-12 | All variants | Same as 01-06 | Replication with independent seeds |
| 13-15 | WT, C677T, Compound | Dimer + FAD + THF | Substrate binding comparison |
| 16 | Wild-type | Dimer + FAD + SAM | Allosteric inhibitor binding |

### Preliminary Monomer Results (March 2026)

| Job | Variant | pTM | ipTM (FAD) | pLDDT@222 | pLDDT@429 |
|-----|---------|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 01 | **WT mono** | 0.80 | 0.97 | 98.5 | 97.5 |
| 03 | **C677T mono** | 0.81 | 0.97 | 98.1 | 97.8 |
| 05 | **A1298C mono** | 0.81 | 0.97 | 98.5 | 97.5 |
| 07 | **WT rep** | 0.81 | 0.98 | 98.5 | 97.5 |
| 09 | **C677T rep** | 0.82 | 0.97 | 98.0 | 97.6 |
| 11 | **A1298C rep** | 0.81 | 0.97 | 98.4 | 97.5 |

**Key observations:**
- All monomer predictions show very high confidence (pTM >0.80, ipTM 0.97-0.98)
- FAD binding is consistently predicted as strong across all variants at the monomer level
- Replicate seeds produce consistent results, confirming prediction reliability
- **Dimer results (pending)** are expected to reveal inter-chain effects and interface disruption not visible in monomers

> **Important:** These are computational predictions, not experimental structures. All confidence metrics should be interpreted as hypothesis generators, not proof of mechanism. See the [full research paper draft](docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_DRAFT.md) for complete methodology and limitations.

## What the Research Shows

### Key Finding: Structural Context for MTHFR Variants

The 2024 cryo-EM structures (PDB 8QA5, 8QA6) revealed for the first time how SAM-mediated allosteric inhibition works through **dual SAM binding** that reorients the catalytic domain and blocks substrate access. This provides critical structural context for understanding the A1298C (E429A) variant, which sits in the regulatory domain near the SAM-binding pocket.

The 2006 structural perturbation study (Pejchal et al.) showed that the C677T (A222V) variant displaces **helix alpha-5**, which carries three FAD-interacting residues (Asn168, Arg171, Lys172). This explains the thermolability -- the variant enzyme loses its FAD cofactor more easily, especially at body temperature.

### Therapeutic Precedent: Base Editing Is Working in Humans

| Program | Company | Target | Delivery | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| VERVE-102 | Verve Therapeutics | PCSK9 (single base edit) | IV LNP | Phase 1b |
| Beam-101 | Beam Therapeutics | Sickle cell (base edit) | Ex vivo | Phase I/II |
| Casgevy | Vertex/CRISPR | Sickle cell / beta-thal | Ex vivo | **FDA Approved (2023)** |

The C677T variant (T>C at DNA level) is a candidate for **adenine base editing (ABE)**, which converts A-T base pairs to G-C base pairs -- the same mechanism used by VERVE-102 currently in clinical trials.
